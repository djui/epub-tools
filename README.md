# EPUB tools

A collection of Shell and Python tools to convert an EPUB to Audiobook.

The Audiobook is generated by text-to-speech synthesis using OS X's `say`
program.

It's a list of hacks over hacks and some manual word remains, but it's better
than not having an Audiobook.


## Usage

1. Install dependencies

    ```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt`
    ```
    
2. Convert EPUB to Audiobook parts per chapter

    ```
    $ ./epub2txt path/to/file.epub
    $ ./txt-split path/to/file.txt
    $ find . -name '*.txt' -exec ./txt2m4b {} \;
    ```
    
3. Fetch cover

    ```
    $ ./fetch-cover $(basename path/to/file.epub)
    ```
 
4. Put all together

  1. Open iTunes and drag'n'drop all `.m4b` files into it.
  2. Select all file and edit its metadata information
     (title, artist, chapter, cover)
